How about if you apply your new strengths to the 
real world data? There are a lot of challenging 
problems waiting to be solved by you. But let's 
start small first. The first step is to get your 
own data. 

Is there any website that you visit every day?
I'm sure it produces fresh content daily: 
new articles, new stats, new numbers. How about 
you start collecting them? If you have your own
data you can use for answering new interesting 
questions.

Does your favorite website have any trends? More
articles are published in summer than winter?
More people are willing to "like" the articles
in spring than in autumn. Is it possible to predict
which article will be more "liked" on Facebook?

If you get an answer you should display it for 
others to see. Do it so that it's pleasurable 
for the eye. Colorful time series or multidimensional 
scaling should do the trick. Describe your graph 
so the people not familiar with your project 
can understand it and enjoy it.

What? It seems a lot of work? Well, here is a source
code that deploys with one command on Google App 
Engine. You just need to focus on where to get 
the data (ETL), what to do with it (DM), and how
to display it (VISUALIZATION). The examples are ready 
for you to swap them with your own.

Little by little you will master how to add monetary
value to your data and sell it in your successful
startup.

## =============================
## == START
## =============================

Create an account and new app placeholder at:

http://appengine.google.com/

Please install Google App Engine SDK from:

http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Getting started with Python web app development is here:

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/

For lunching the app you can use this nice GUI:

## =============================
## == INTRO
## =============================

This is example of a simple data mining application.
Here, HN aggregator is our source of data. The data
mining objective is to figure out when is good time
to post an article or a story.

## =============================
## == MODEL
## =============================

This app should serve as a company business model.
The application of this model is business to business
service. The claim is that DATA MINING applications 
bring better EXPERIENCE, OUTCOMES, and VALUE to 
customer`s, i.e., company`s, current services. 
There are many problems that can be solved using
existing electronic data. Since almost very company
produces some sort of electronic data there is 
a vast market waiting to be improved.

## =============================
## == CODE
## =============================

Most data mining application will have similar 
framework and data flow:

1.ETL -> 2.DM -> 3.VISUALIZATION

1.GET THE DATA -> 2.ADD VALUE -> 3.USE IT

1. ETL = Extract, Transform, Load (GET THE DATA)
2. DM = Data Mining (ENRICH THE DATA, ADD VALUE)
3. VISUALISATION = Data presentation in a format 
   that can support decision making process (USE IT, SHOW IT)

This is how the code is organized. You can think of 
it as a "Hello, World!" data mining web service 
and application. Data can be visualized using JS frameworks
or it can be imported to external desktop software through JSON.

## =============================
## == WARNING
## =============================

This app shows the raw data to support the decision if 
it`s good time to post on HN or not. Most often it`s 
not a good idea to show the raw data to the client since
it clogs the interface with unnecessary information.

## =============================
## == HOPE
## =============================

The hope, here, is that young start-ups can use this 
code to quickly organize and prototype their idea. 
Google App Engine can run this app for free, giving
opportunity to demonstrate their idea to potential
investors.
