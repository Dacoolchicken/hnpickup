## =============================
## == INTRO
## =============================

This is example of a simple data mining application.
Here, HN aggregator is our source of data. The data
mining objective is to figure out when is good time
to post an article, i.e., story.

## =============================
## == MODEL
## =============================

This app should serve as a company business model.
The application of this model is business to business
service. The claim is that DATA MINING applications 
bring better EXPERIENCE, OUTCOMES, and VALUE to 
customer`s, i.e., company`s, current services. 
There are many problems that can be solved using
existing electronic data. Since almost very company
produces some sort of electronic data there is 
a vast market waiting to be improved.

## =============================
## == CODE
## =============================

Most data mining application will have similar 
framework and data flow:

1.ETL -> 2.DM -> 3.VISUALIZATION

1. ETL = Extract, Transform, Load
2. DM = Data Mining
3. VISUALISATION = Data presentation in a format
that can support decision making process

This is how the code is organized. You can think of 
it as a "Hello, World!" data mining web service 
and application.

## =============================
## == WARNING
## =============================

This app shows the raw data to support the decision if 
it`s good time to post on HN or not. Most often it`s 
not a good idea to show the raw data to the client since
it clogs the interface with unnecessary information.

## =============================
## == HOPE
## =============================

The hope, here, is that young start-ups can use this 
code to quickly organize and prototype their idea. 
Google App Engine can run this app for free, giving
opportunity to demonstrate their idea to potential
investors.
